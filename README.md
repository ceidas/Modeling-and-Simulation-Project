# Modeling-and-Simulation-Project

This project was completed in 2018 as part of my postgraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering.

Context: Modeling and simulating femoral neck fractures using Finite Element Analysis.

Finite element Analysis of femoral neck fractures using FEBio Suite and OpenSim

Assignments :

- Searching and reading Scientific bibliography about FEA and femoral neck fractures simulations

- Extracting materials properties of cortical bone (Density, Young Modulus, Poisson's Ratio)

- Estimation of join reaction forces on OpenSim, using a musculoskeletal model and the gait dataset which were provided

- Specifying boundaries conditions on FEBio

- Applying “Boundary load” on FEbio

- Running the simulation and finding the forces loading to the femur during walking (maximum stress, Pressure points, Maximal Stress Distribution)

- Compering different models (Normal bone, normal with lower density, Osteoporosis)

Software: OpenSim, FEBio suite, Libre Office

Methods: Modeling and Simulation, Inverse Kinematics

OS: Linux-Ubuntu & Windows 10

Achievements: Successful implementation of all tasks. However the results of the numbers we took for unknown reason were not realistic according to official literature (probably the mesh file had a bug or less possible there was wrong convention with the values input and the mesh file that was used).

*Rest files due to their large size, can not be uploaded to github
